# Generative Adversarial Networks
Surya Dantuluri's Speech on Generative Adversarial Networks and It's Implementations Notes and Supplementary Material

Here are some unformatted notes and citations(which I will format in the upcoming days)

0.0002 learning rate), come on the network cant really memorize at this stage.
DCGAN

When you have a lot of neural networks (multilayer) thatâ€™s called deep learning

Stuff to look at:

https://github.com/LantaoYu/SeqGAN
https://github.com/SKTBrain/DiscoGAN
https://github.com/stormraiser/GAN-weight-norm --weight normalization is better than batch normalization

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10717--training auto-encoder based Generative Adversarial Networks. This method balances the generator and discriminator during training
